# Latitude AI — AI Studio Challenge Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of **Break Through Tech AI Studio**.  
It proposes the development of a **graphical user interface (GUI)** designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of large, open-source driving datasets such as **Argoverse, KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset**.

By leveraging the capabilities of **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, the GUI will allow users to:

- Efficiently search for specific content within these complex datasets.
- Generate concise summaries of interesting or anomalous events.

The core innovation is the application of advanced machine learning techniques to **extract meaningful insights without extensive model retraining**, focusing instead on practical implementation.  
This approach aims to significantly reduce the manual effort currently required to navigate and understand vast collections of visual and sensor data.

## Repository Structure

- **frontend/** → Next.js / React app for the GUI -- undecided
- **backend/** → APIs, search, summarization, and VLM integration
- **data/** → placeholder for datasets (ignored in git)
- **docs/** → documentation, architecture diagrams, notes
- **notebooks/** → experiments and model prototyping
- **tests/** → test cases
